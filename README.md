# ERA-SESSION25 : Reinforcement Learning: Continuous Action Spaces with Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3)

## TD3 Architecture

In TD3 model, the actor target outputs action (a). The action (a) and state (s) are used as input to critic target. The two critic target output two Q value. Take the minimum value of the two Q value, add a stochastic noise to it, and we get the target Q value. The target Q value is compared to the two Q value from the critic model. From there, we get two loss value. 
For Q learning in TD3 model, we use back propagation to minimise the loss value.

##  TRAINING PROCESS 

### STEP 1
- We initialize the Experience Replay Memory with a size of 1e6.
- Then we populate it with new transitions.
```python
  class ReplayBuffer(object):
    
  def __init__(self, max_size=1e6):
    self.storage = []
    self.max_size = max_size
    self.ptr = 0

  def add(self, transition):
    if len(self.storage) == self.max_size:
      self.storage[int(self.ptr)] = transition
      self.ptr = (self.ptr + 1) % self.max_size
    else:
      self.storage.append(transition)
      self.ptr = (self.ptr + 1) % self.max_size

  def sample(self, batch_size):
    ind = np.random.randint(0, len(self.storage), size=batch_size)
    batch_states, batch_next_states, batch_actions, batch_rewards, batch_dones = [], [], [], [], []
    for i in ind:
      state, next_state, action, reward, done = self.storage[i]
      batch_states.append(np.array(state, copy=False))
      batch_next_states.append(np.array(next_state, copy=False))
      batch_actions.append(np.array(action, copy=False))
      batch_rewards.append(np.array(reward, copy=False))
      batch_dones.append(np.array(done, copy=False))
    return np.array(batch_states), np.array(batch_next_states), np.array(batch_actions), np.array(batch_rewards).reshape(-1, 1), np.array(batch_dones).reshape(-1, 1)
```
### STEP 2
- Build one DNN for the Actor model and one for the Actor Target.
```python
class Actor(nn.Module):
    
  def __init__(self, state_dim, action_dim, max_action):
    super(Actor, self).__init__()
    self.layer_1 = nn.Linear(state_dim, 400)
    self.layer_2 = nn.Linear(400, 300)
    self.layer_3 = nn.Linear(300, action_dim)
    self.max_action = max_action

  def forward(self, x):
    x = F.relu(self.layer_1(x))
    x = F.relu(self.layer_2(x))
    x = self.max_action * torch.tanh(self.layer_3(x))
    return x
```

### STEP 3
- Build two DNNs for the two Critic models and two DNNs for the two Critic Targets.
```python
class Critic(nn.Module):
    
  def __init__(self, state_dim, action_dim):
    super(Critic, self).__init__()
    # Defining the first Critic neural network
    self.layer_1 = nn.Linear(state_dim + action_dim, 400)
    self.layer_2 = nn.Linear(400, 300)
    self.layer_3 = nn.Linear(300, 1)
    # Defining the second Critic neural network
    self.layer_4 = nn.Linear(state_dim + action_dim, 400)
    self.layer_5 = nn.Linear(400, 300)
    self.layer_6 = nn.Linear(300, 1)

  def forward(self, x, u):
    xu = torch.cat([x, u], 1)
    # Forward-Propagation on the first Critic Neural Network
    x1 = F.relu(self.layer_1(xu))
    x1 = F.relu(self.layer_2(x1))
    x1 = self.layer_3(x1)
    # Forward-Propagation on the second Critic Neural Network
    x2 = F.relu(self.layer_4(xu))
    x2 = F.relu(self.layer_5(x2))
    x2 = self.layer_6(x2)
    return x1, x2

  def Q1(self, x, u):
    xu = torch.cat([x, u], 1)
    x1 = F.relu(self.layer_1(xu))
    x1 = F.relu(self.layer_2(x1))
    x1 = self.layer_3(x1)
    return x1

```

### STEP 4-15
- Training Process.
```python
def train(self, replay_buffer, iterations, batch_size=100, discount=0.99, tau=0.005, policy_noise=0.2, noise_clip=0.5, policy_freq=2):

    for it in range(iterations):

      # Step 4: We sample a batch of transitions (s, s’, a, r) from the memory
      batch_states, batch_next_states, batch_actions, batch_rewards, batch_dones = replay_buffer.sample(batch_size)
      state = torch.Tensor(batch_states).to(device)
      next_state = torch.Tensor(batch_next_states).to(device)
      action = torch.Tensor(batch_actions).to(device)
      reward = torch.Tensor(batch_rewards).to(device)
      done = torch.Tensor(batch_dones).to(device)

      # Step 5: From the next state s’, the Actor target plays the next action a’
      next_action = self.actor_target(next_state)

      # Step 6: We add Gaussian noise to this next action a’ and we clamp it in a range of values supported by the environment
      noise = torch.Tensor(batch_actions).data.normal_(0, policy_noise).to(device)
      noise = noise.clamp(-noise_clip, noise_clip)
      next_action = (next_action + noise).clamp(-self.max_action, self.max_action)

      # Step 7: The two Critic targets take each the couple (s’, a’) as input and return two Q-values Qt1(s’,a’) and Qt2(s’,a’) as outputs
      target_Q1, target_Q2 = self.critic_target(next_state, next_action)

      # Step 8: We keep the minimum of these two Q-values: min(Qt1, Qt2)
      target_Q = torch.min(target_Q1, target_Q2)

      # Step 9: We get the final target of the two Critic models, which is: Qt = r + γ * min(Qt1, Qt2), where γ is the discount factor
      target_Q = reward + ((1 - done) * discount * target_Q).detach()

      # Step 10: The two Critic models take each the couple (s, a) as input and return two Q-values Q1(s,a) and Q2(s,a) as outputs
      current_Q1, current_Q2 = self.critic(state, action)

      # Step 11: We compute the loss coming from the two Critic models: Critic Loss = MSE_Loss(Q1(s,a), Qt) + MSE_Loss(Q2(s,a), Qt)
      critic_loss = F.mse_loss(current_Q1, target_Q) + F.mse_loss(current_Q2, target_Q)

      # Step 12: We backpropagate this Critic loss and update the parameters of the two Critic models with a SGD optimizer
      self.critic_optimizer.zero_grad()
      critic_loss.backward()
      self.critic_optimizer.step()

      # Step 13: Once every two iterations, we update our Actor model by performing gradient ascent on the output of the first Critic model
      if it % policy_freq == 0:
        actor_loss = -self.critic.Q1(state, self.actor(state)).mean()
        self.actor_optimizer.zero_grad()
        actor_loss.backward()
        self.actor_optimizer.step()

        # Step 14: Still once every two iterations, we update the weights of the Actor target by polyak averaging
        for param, target_param in zip(self.actor.parameters(), self.actor_target.parameters()):
          target_param.data.copy_(tau * param.data + (1 - tau) * target_param.data)

        # Step 15: Still once every two iterations, we update the weights of the Critic target by polyak averaging
        for param, target_param in zip(self.critic.parameters(), self.critic_target.parameters()):
          target_param.data.copy_(tau * param.data + (1 - tau) * target_param.data)

```

### Evaluation Policy
- Make a function that evaluates the policy by calculating its average rewards over 10 episodes.
```python
def evaluate_policy(policy, eval_episodes=10):
    avg_reward = 0.
    for _ in range(eval_episodes):
        obs = env.reset()
        done = False
        while not done:
            action = policy.select_action(np.array(obs))
            obs, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
            avg_reward += reward
    avg_reward /= eval_episodes
    print ("---------------------------------------")
    print ("Average Reward over the Evaluation Step: %f" % (avg_reward))
    print ("---------------------------------------")
    return avg_reward
```
